            <h2>why coffe makes your day batter</h2>
            <h4>1 coffe can boost your happy hormones</h4>
            <p> Coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant that can boost mood and energy levels. The caffeine in coffee works by increasing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which can lead to feelings of happiness and euphoria. Additionally, the act of drinking coffee can be associated with positive experiences, such as getting out for a walk or taking a break from work, which can also contribute to feelings of happiness.</p>
            <h4>2 Pleasure from drinking something delicious</h4>
            <p>Eating or drinking something delicious can bring happiness through the release of pleasure-inducing chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine. Additionally, the act of eating or drinking can be associated with positive memories and social connections, further increasing feelings of happiness. The sense of taste is closely linked to the sense of smell, which can also play a role in the enjoyment of food, as the aroma can enhance the flavour experience. Overall, the combination of pleasure from the taste, memories, and social connections can create a positive emotional response associated with eating and drinking delicious things.</p>
            <h4>3 Having a routine contributes to happiness</h4>
            <p>Routine can bring a sense of stability and predictability to one's life, which can lead to feelings of happiness. Having a consistent schedule and knowing what to expect can reduce stress and anxiety, as well as increase a sense of control over one's life. Additionally, routine can also provide a sense of accomplishment, as completing daily tasks can give a sense of purpose and satisfaction. Establishing healthy routines, such as regular exercise or waking up early and brewing yourself the perfect coffee, can also contribute to physical and mental well-being.</p>
            <h4>4 Take it one step further and turn your routine into a ritual</h4>
            <p>We have written a lot about the power of ritual when it comes to happiness.Rituals can also be used to establish a connection with something greater than oneself, whether it is through religious or spiritual practices, through connecting with nature or through simply transforming something ordinary into something special, sacred or meaningful to you it really can be as simple as taking the time to turn your morning coffee into a conscious practice. These rituals can bring a sense of peace and fulfilment, contributing to overall feelings of happiness.</p>
